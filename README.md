## Workflow

The following is an outline of what we need to do, what is done and what is currently being worked on. This is just how I structure my projects so that I can see my progress over time. If you are working on this project you do not have to use this but I just encourage you to use it, because it does prevent 2 people from working on 1 thing at the same time.
